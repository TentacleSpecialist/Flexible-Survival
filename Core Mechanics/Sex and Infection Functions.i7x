Definition: A person (called x) is sterile:
	if "Sterile" is listed in feats of x, yes;
	no;

Definition: A person (called x) is FullyNewTypeInfected:

	if AssName of x is "", no;
	if TailName of x is "", no;
	if CockName of x is "", no;
	if CuntName of x is "", no;
	yes;

to decide if ( x - a text ) is an/-- OviImpregnator:
	let ExclusionList be { "", "None", "Human" };
	if x is "Player":
		if TorsoName of Player is not listed in ExclusionList and TorsoName of Player is listed in infections of OviImpregnatorList, decide yes;
		if BodyName of Player is not listed in ExclusionList and BodyName of Player is listed in infections of OviImpregnatorList, decide yes;
	else:
		if x is not listed in ExclusionList and x is listed in infections of OviImpregnatorList, decide yes;
	decide no;

to decide if (x - a person) has a body of (i - a text):
	if TorsoName of x is i, decide yes;
	if BodyName of x is i, decide yes;
	decide no;

to decide if (x - a person) has no body of (i - a text):
	if x has a body of i, decide no;
	decide yes;

to decide if the/-- Player has a non-shifting body of (i - a text):
	if Player is shifter, decide no;
	if Player has a body of i, decide yes;
	decide no;

to decide if the/-- Player has no non-shifting body of (i - a text):
	if Player is shifter, decide yes;
	if Player has a body of i, decide no;
	decide yes;

[@Todo: Handle new style infection here when implemented]
to decide if (x - a person) has a skin of (i - a text):
	if SkinName of x is i, decide yes;
	decide no;

to decide which text is GetSpeciesName from (N - a text):
	if N is not "" and there is a Name of N in the Table of Random Critters:
		choose a row with Name of N in the Table of Random Critters;
		if Species Name entry is not "":
			decide on Species Name entry;
		else:
			decide on N;
	decide on ""; [Name not found or N is empty - Return "" as a failsafe]

to remove manhood from ( x - a person ):
	now Cock Count of x is 0;
	now Cock Length of x is 0;
	now Ball Size of x is 0;

to remove womanhood from ( x - a person ):
	now Cunt Count of x is 0;
	now Cunt Depth of x is 0;
	now Cunt Tightness of x is 0;

[compares genitals and returns a number for the result]
[ > 0 - x is either a pure male or a herm and the cock is longer ]
[ = 0 - x is either a neuter or a herm and cock length and cunt depth are the same ]
[ < 0 - x is either a pure female or a herm and the cunt is deeper ]
to decide which number is compare genitals of ( x - a person ):
	if x is puremale, decide on Cock Length of x;
	if x is neuter, decide on 0;
	if x is purefemale, decide on 0 - Cunt Depth of x;
	[x is a herm:]
	decide on Cock Length of x - Cunt Depth of x;

[
[ Example for later use. e. g.: if GetBallSize of Player > 4: ]
to decide which number is GetBallSize of ( x - a person ):
	if x is male, decide on Ball Size of x;
	decide on 0;
