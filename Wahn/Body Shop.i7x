Body Shop is a room.
Body Shop is southeast of Mall East Wing.
Description of Body Shop is "[BodyShopDesc]".

to say BodyShopDesc:
	say "     This room seems to have been a clothing boutique before the chaos started - at least judging by the wide-open floorspace, the row of changing booths in the back and numerous mannequins standing around motionlessly. Interestingly, none of the dolls actually wears a shred of clothing, with all of the former merchandise and the stands they were offered on pushed into an untidy heap in one corner of the store. No, what is being presented now instead are the mannequins themselves... on a second look, you see that they often vary from the 'typical' stature of sexless store mannequins. A row of them at the shop windows sports impressive erections - equine, canine, feline and human, to name just a few, while other little groups have a variety of facial features and body plans. Further in the back are several that one might believe customers at first - fully formed anthros with life-like skin, feathers or otherwise - if they didn't stand quite so motionless and still...";
	if Daytimer is Day:
		say "     The storekeeper is a large naga, who slithers through the room on his brightly colored scales, always ready to welcome new customers strolling in through the door. There is a slow but relatively steady trickle of interested people straying into the Body Shop, looking with interest at all the displays and appearing to think about what they see. 'Come in and look around at your leisure,' Moreau says in a welcoming manner, inviting them to have a closer inspection, and even offering to have the mannequins pose side to side with customers, even holding out their own body parts to compare.";

To say MoreauDesc:
	if debugactive is 1:
		say "DEBUG -> HP of Moreau: [HP of Moreau], Libido of Moreau: [Libido of Moreau] <- DEBUG[line break]";
	say "     Moreau is a snake... quite literally so, as most of his body is purely ophidian, going on and on as it slowly tapers. But in addition to that, he does have a waist too - you can see the typical little bulges where the hip-bone are right under the skin, and above that a human-like torso, giving him arms and opposable thumbs. A quick glance down to his crotch reveals that it is smooth and relatively bare, with just a narrow slit between the rows of scales - no telling what might or might not be hidden inside that. The naga bears a truly awe-inspiring set of scales, with vibrant shades of red, orange and yellow making him almost appear like a dragon, complete with a little crest of scale-tips standing up on his broad snake-head. ";
	say "     In a sharp contrast to his fiery-colored body, the storekeeper's large eyes are startlingly green, making you freeze where you stand as he notices your attention and focuses his gaze on you in turn. The emerald, slit-pupiled orbs seem like bottomless pools you could stare at forever and lose yourself in... and you almost do, before he turns his head and breaks the stare. Opening his mouth a fraction, the naga tastes the air with his split tongue and then smiles at you, waving you closer with an inviting gesture.";

Instead of fucking Moreau:
	if Affection of Moreau < 3:
		say "     As you approach the naga and offer sex, Moreau raises the scaled ridges above his eyes and gives you an unimpressed look. 'We barely know each other! No thank you, I for one am not on par with the wild beasts roaming the streets.' That said, he makes a cutting gesture in the air with his hand, signifying that the topic is over. Maybe you should try talking to him and getting to know Moreau first...";
	else if Affection of Moreau > 2:
		say "     As you approach the naga and offer sex, Moreau raises the scaled ridges above his eyes and a slight smile crosses his face. He lets his gaze roam over your body while his forked tongue flicks out and tastes the air between you. 'While you're certainly a very becoming person,' he says with a smile at you, half-raising a hand to reach out, then pulling it back. 'Right now isn't a good time I'm afraid. I do have the store open, and customers are coming in. It'd be... unprofessional.' With an apologetic sway of his head, the naga slithers to the side a little at this point, actually calling out to welcome someone wandering in through the door, which does prove his point.";


Instead of conversing the Moreau:
	project the figure of Moreau_face_icon;
	if PlayerMet of Moreau is false:
		say "     'Welcome to my store,' the large snake hybrid pushes his lower body up to give you a gracious bow with his humanoid upper body. Then he snakes his way closer before coiling up right in front of where you stand, giving an inviting wave of his arm to indicate the mannequins lined up at the front of the store. 'Did something in the shop windows catch your eye? The offered wares are subject to change, and I do circle through the newer parts for people to have a look at.' You look around at the collection of mannequins, then ask what he actually sells. 'Why, bodies of course. Everything about them. The signage and name of the store are quite clear, are they not? Come, let me show you.' Miming you to walk over to the next bunch of mannequins, the ophidian storekeeper keeps up with your steps in a smooth glide of his scales on the tiled floor, stopping before the display models.";
		say "     'The world is in flux, down to literally the body you have - but many, oh so very many of people are dissatisfied with their adopted shapes. Maybe they were forced to shift, or couldn't help but succumb into it, and now they feel like they deserve... better. I offer this service, for a price.' Smiling at you, he then turns to stare directly at a mannequin displaying some characteristics of anthro gryphon. It appears somewhat eerie, as if one had switched body parts to make a hybrid creature, part alive and part plastic. While the showpiece's head is that of an almost featureless doll, with a plastic-y sheen and not even a mouth and nostrils, the rest of it is a perfect depiction a real anthro gryphon, its body detailing everything exactly, from the tips of the clawed digitigrade feet, up over a hermaphrodite's set of cock, balls and even the slit of a moist pussy. The pair of wings behind its back have individual feathers. It does not move, not even a little, or breathe.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Giving you a sidelong glance that tells you he loves showing off, Moreau crooks his finger a little at the mannequin - and the human-sized doll instantly reacts, walking over to come stand before you with startling suddenness. As it comes to stand in front of you in an 'at rest' position, you can't help but gulp and glance around. Ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-six, -seven, -eight... there are about thirty of those things in here, which makes you feel less like on a shopping trip and more like standing in the midst of a pride of lions. 'Do not be concerned, my assistants are perfectly well behaved. Watch this one for example,' Moreau says, amusement underlying his voice as he puts the gryphon doll through its paces, spinning around slowly, stretching and showing off the details of its shape.";
		say "     Once he is satisfied with the mannequin, Moreau sends it back to the original position and turns back to you. 'I can offer the service of giving people what they want. And even more than that - I give a warranty. No more losing what you so dearly desired, you understand,' the snake tells you in a quite smooth-talking voice, guiding you in a tour through the store, past numerous of the motionless living dolls. While you walk, your gaze falls upon a treasure-trove of supplies stacked up in the back. He must have weeks forth of food and water there! Curiosity drives you to check it out from up close, but after a few steps, the naga's hand slides under your arm and gently but firmly tugs you back to his tour. Then you notice that every last one of the mannequins in the whole store turned their head towards you when you came close to the supplies. They quickly take their positions again, but you can't help but shiver a little from so many featureless faces staring at you.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Finally arriving back where you started after having shown off all sorts of creature parts you never even knew existed, Moreau smiles and shows his forked tongue for a second. 'As you can see, I do have much to offer. It depends a bit on what people sell to me, so be sure to get anything you desire immediately, so it is not sold out by the time you return. You will find the prices very reasonable for this unique service...'";

When this all started, seeing all the changes happening around this city had started to give me some vague ideas along the lines of this shop, but it wasn't until I stumbled on a discarded mannequin on the side of the road that those ideas really clicked together. And so I came here, where I knew there might be those who would be interested in body changing services. With a bit of my own [italic type]special[roman type] talent I was able to gather the mannequins you see here and have them serve my purposes. The process took some refining, but I think the result has been well worth it all.'";

Having seen what they do to those they defeat, I saw it as a public service to collect a number and take them out of roaming the streets. After the first two or three, it became easier, with the previous ones to hold down the next. So yes, my mannequins are from out in the city.

to BodyChoiceDilemmaEvent:
	say "     As you enter Moreau's shop, you are surprised not to be immediately greeted by its serpentine owner. The reason becomes clear after you notice him further in the Body Shop, standing next to a buff, tall, seemingly very pensive horseman. Said horseman is gazing in the direction of two mannequins. The first one is displaying anthro snow leopard parts; not just a crotch or tail, but an entire body, complete with fur, a feline face, and an overall feminine look, although the furry sheath between the mannequin's legs marks this body as male. Next to it is a second mannequin, this one unmistakably female for it has the body parts of a succubus. As you glance over a scene you would qualify as implausible were it not taking place in this strange shop, Moreau finally notices you: 'Welcome, [if Player is not defaultnamed][name of Player][else]my friend[end if]. I apologize for not greeting you right away, but as you can see I am currently tending to the needs of another customer. Actually...' he adds with a thoughtful look, 'If I was bold enough, I would ask you a little help tending to those needs. Hmm...'";
	say "     The naga leaves his words hang in the air, closing his eyes as if he was deeply pondering the question; although your instincts tell you this is at best a facade, and at worst a shameless attempt at manipulation, the uncomfortable silence that follows eventually drives you to ask how you can help him. With an apologetic smile, Moreau explains: 'Well, as most beings who come here, my current client has a desire of change. Although he had a very clear idea what kind of body he wanted for himself, coming down on the specifics has been... complex. I would like you to help the poor man make up his mind. I feel the need to mention that I would be... somewhat discontent to see him leave without making a purchase.' The naga discreetly points at a rather large pile of canned food, no doubt the price one would have to pay for a full new body.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     As the shop owner seems intent on letting you learn more from the source, you walk to the large black horse whose gaze just goes on one mannequin and then on the other as he taps a finger against his chin. When you introduce yourself, the stud's low, manly voices betrays his anxiety: 'Oh sorry man, am I holding the alligator guy all to myself?' As you notice the look of surprise and indignation on Moreau's face at being called such a thing, you assure his horse client that it is no problem at all, but that you'd love to know if you could help with whatever decision the equine has to make. 'Oh thanks, that's really nice! See, before the infection-the name's Jaime, by the way-, before the infection I was already super buff and a really big dude, in more ways than one. All the girls and small guys at the gym were into me, and I was into them too, so when I ended up a horse, it didn't feel all that weird, at least compared to how it was to most people.'";
	say "     'I enjoyed being a horse. Heck, I enjoyed it a REAL lot. Maybe overdid it a bit too.' The stranger rubs the back of his head, visibly having trouble exposing his feelings. 'But since a little while, I've surprised myself being curious of those girls and smaller guys, and how much they enjoy it every time I fuck them. Like, I LOVE being a top, but them, they look like they're in trance. Anyway, long story short, curiosity became envy, and eventually I started imagining I was the people I was fucking. Like, you know... During. Then I hear about a shop in the mall where you can actually buy body parts for supplies, and it sounds crazy, but I think [']What if?['] and I start rationing my supplies. And there I am. I decided I wanted more than just bottoming, I want... I want the full experience, to know what it feels like to be weaker, and delicate, and manhandled by a bigger guy!' he says, his voice betraying his anticipation.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     So, I want a whole new body, everything new. I was afraid I wouldn't have enough supplies for it, but luckily turns out I did.' Something, more precisely how Moreau chooses this moment to look away as if suddenly interested in what was going on outside the store, tells you that the horse likely brought more than what was necessary, but that the naga 'forgot' to mention that fact. While you disregard the thought, Jaime concludes: 'But now that I see those two amazing, beautiful bodies, I can't decide. Should I be male or female? I can't decide, and I can't afford a second change if I'm unsatisfied with my new body. I've been rationing my food for so long now...' As he is lost in thought once again, nervously looking at the mannequins, you see that it's up to you to help him make up his mind.";

As you slowly turn to the naga, crossing your arms and raising an eyebrow, the shop keeper lets out a discreet but genuine laugh at being caught red-handed and starts speaking after a little cough. 'Well a client getting a full body change is a rare occurrence, and as such it would be a shame to see you leave this shop not fully satisfied, so I could... Bend the rules a bit, and grant you two sets of genitals. On the house.'";

Hermaphrodite succubus, for lack of a better term.' The horse thinks for a moment, and the two of you start fearing that you might be facing yet another dilemma, but he soon nods and states 'I think I'd like to be a snow leopard.

Visibly, whatever funny thing is happening, he is not particularly amused. Has his shop been taken over by the infected? When he notices you, you make a gesture as to ask if something is wrong, but he simply answers with a shrug and a sigh, indicating that he intends on dealing with whatever this is on his own. You relax and decide to observe the scene instead.";

Furthermore, it has become abundantly clear by now that every single one of them is completely and unmistakably drunk, some even needing help to keep standing. The group's attention at the moment appears to be on an identically inebriated mouse boy, who seems both nervous and excited at whatever is coming. The rest of the group suddenly turns to Moreau, enthusiastically chanting 'Go! Go! Go!' When he rolls his eyes and presents a hand, a fox plunges his hands in a container you hadn't spotted before, grabbing two full beer packs and offering them to the shop owner while bowing down in an absurdly over-the-top way, which his friends appear to find absolutely hilarious.";
		WaitLineBreak;

Although a more clear-headed person could have found the situation disturbing or even worrying, the mouse seems to share the general opinion that it is instead utterly amusing, and as you cannot for the life of you guess what is about to take place, you are surprised to see the mouse cover his eyes with one paw and point in front of him with other. Then, the group start chanting 'Spin! Spin! Spin!', and the mouse does start spinning, rotating as fast as possible while blind and barely managing not to fall flat on his face in the process.";
		say "     Then, the mouse suddenly stops, his hand still pointing in front of him, or more accurately now pointing at the mannequin he happened to stop in the direction of. Said mannequin is displaying wolf parts for sale, and, for some reason, whatever is happening right now makes the rest of the group cheer louder than ever, as if their friend had just accomplished something spectacular. You're still as confused as before this all started when they start chanting 'Spin! Spin! Spin!' once again, and the mouse resumes his spinning. When he stops a second time, he is now pointing at a mannequin with eagle attributes, which apparently is as hilarious to the group at the first time this happened. By the time the strange ritual starts a third time, you give up on trying to understand and just wait to see where this is going.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     The strange game takes place before your eyes a total of five times, with the mouse also stopping in the direction of mannequins with pig, satyr, and equine body parts respectively, until all members of the group turn to Moreau's direction yet again. The shop's owner, not even bothering to crack a smile, takes the mouse to the changing rooms, while the other infected gather around the container and grab more beers to drink. After a little while, their friend comes back, greeted by deafening cheers and clapping; or at least, you assume it's their friend. The former mouse now display a completely mismatched new body, with a wolf head, eagle body shape, pig skin, satyr tail and ass, and the pussy of a mare. The whole thing, frankly, does not come out to you as very pleasing to the eye, but the drunk party members appear not to share your opinion as they keep on cheering and chanting.";
		say "     The mouse boy, or rather the ill-assorted woman, is soon given a fresh beer that she immediately start gulping down in one go. After some drunken debate, a mall rat boy is pushed where the once-mouse boy previously stood, and the group turns to Moreau again chanting 'Go! Go! Go' while handing him two more six packs. Having no choice but to wait, you patiently witness two more people play this little game and end up with strange mismatched infections, before the group eventually decides it had enough and noisily leaves the shop, leaving behind empty beer cans and not even bothering to thank or say goodbye to the naga. You hear their chants in the distance for quite some time, and can safely assume that the party is far from over for them. Hopefully, they won't do anything stupid - or rather, anything even more stupid than this.";

'Eight of them played that game. [italic type]Eight[roman type].' He sighs as he completes his cleaning, still unnerved by the experience. 'Let's hope that they don't end up regretting their decisions once they sober up, assuming they ever stop partying enough for that to happen. Because they are [italic type]not[roman type] getting those parts back for free after such insufferable behavior in my shop. This is a worthy establishment, not some rave party in somebody's backyard! Oh, well. At least I got a very good deal out of it.'

I am sympathetic towards your situation, but a full body change is a lot to ask for with only four bottles of water to pay for it.' The hyena lets out an enraged grunt and kicks the bottles of water laying on the ground, likely the ones she brought as payment, causing the shop owner to sigh heavily. 'If you are going to cause trouble, I am going to ask you to leave. I want to help, but there is a limit to my kindness. You simply don't have enough supplies.'";
		say "     The hyena mumbles swear words and closes her eyes in silence, likely trying to think of another solution to her problem. Meanwhile, you discreetly approach Moreau and ask what is going on. The reptile whispers back at you: 'This lady, Tirsa, is from the High Rise District. She used to be a female panther, but after stepping in the wrong puddle, unfortunately grew a penis. Having heard of me, she made her way from the High Rise District, but on the way was attacked by a gang of hyena bikers who, apparently... Urinated on her. All of them. Hence her current look, and exasperated state of mind. Of course,' he adds, 'the problem is that what she brought as payment is no longer enough. She would like a full female panther body like she used to have, but for that, four bottles of water just isn't enough, even if I'm feeling generous. And I'm rarely generous.'";

I'm already taking a risk just by having to walk back home, and if I get back just to get more supplies and come back, it's three trips instead of one! And I can't scavenge for more supplies, I don't know how to fight! I'm gonna end up eaten by a wyvern, or something even more horrible!' Feeling bad for her, you try to convince the shop owner that he can't let a defenseless woman risk her life just to get him more supplies. After all, what if the word got around that he sent a defenseless woman in the streets to scavenge more supplies for him?";
		say "     The naga rests his head on his fist and closes his eyes, taking a moment to think. Seeing an opportunity, Tirsa is quick to add: 'A-and I would totally talk about your shop to everybody I know at the High Rise District! I know, like, a REAL lot of people there. Rich ones, too! Maybe... I can tell them about your shop, and how cool it is to choose whatever parts you want? I used to be a renowned fashion critic, before this whole thing. A lot of them knew me by reputation before they even met me after the infection. I came here on my own, but if people were to have an interest in this shop, they might be able to secure a root. People where I come from have a massive amount of supplies, they can pay for anything!'";

Tell you what, I'll accept your proposition, but I'll add a new condition: although I will give you back the panther body you want, I will [italic type]not[roman type] remove the penis you have.' Before she can protest, he adds: 'Not yet, at least. But if you do what you promise and bring new clients from the High Rise District to my shop, then I will consider your part of the deal complete and make this last little change you desire.' The hyena doesn't seem to pleased. 'My husband won't like that... He's not really into penises.' The naga smirks and gives a little snort. 'Then I guess your sex life will be rather empty until you complete your part of the deal. Makes this a safer bet for me.'";
		say "     If looks could kill, the naga would be annihilated on the spot but eventually, Tirsa can only comply. 'Well, I guess that's the best deal I can get, isn't it? Damn, now I'm gonna have to [italic type]actually[roman type] promote this place.' The naga smiles. 'It would appear so!' Eventually, he leads the hyena to the changing rooms, and she comes out a full panther, although, as promised, Moreau did not restore her crotch to a fully female state. She walks to you and says 'I completely forgot to thank you. If it weren't for you I would have a penis AND be a hyena, and be in a lot more trouble too. I guess now all that's left to do is to promote people in the Body Shop. I should manage; you'd be surprised. I WAS pretty famous back in the day.'";

Anyways, there's various ways of hypnotic influence...' With that, he starts a nice little discussion with you about what can be done, and what not.

Only a thin slit between the smooth scales of the naga indicates the presence of genitals, although on second glance... it isn't quite as thin and invisible between his scales as usual, when he's in the store. Given that Moreau doesn't wear clothing at all, your gaze must have slipped over the section of his body more than a few times just today, yet it never looked like this. The fleshy sides of the opening look just a little swollen and parted, with a glisten of wetness on them. Setting a fingertip on the slit, you gently push, finding it readily allowing your digit entrance to a sort of soft pouch that is slick and moist around your finger. After a little bit more than an inch of penetration, you encounter something firm, yet yielding. As you rub it, you hearing a pleased grunt from Moreau/Anton.";

Your touch obviously arouses him, as it doesn't take long before you can see the tip start pushing apart the opening of Moreau's genital slit. His manhood is vibrantly colored, reddish-orange in contrast to the yellow scales of the naga's front, and you wrap your fingers and thumb around it as soon as the dickhead has fully emerged. As you're getting a better grip of his cock and massage it, Moreau's erection grows much faster than it did before, revealing inch after inch of a ridged shaft that promises quite a ride for his sexual partners. By the time he's showing about nine inches of cock, you think he's done growing, until suddenly, the genital-slit stretches wide to allow for a bulge to squeeze past with a sudden slurp. Moreau's got something akin to a canine knot at the base of his shaft, which is now revealed to be a full twelve inches!";

The firm shaft of the naga is warm against your tongue, leaking precum right onto your taste-buds. Moreau's juices have an interesting, almost spicy flavor to them, and you find yourself enjoying going down on him. Remembering to assist Moreau/Anton in the same movements as before, you blindly grope to bring his hand up to your head, only to find that he's actually already reaching for you. A second later, the long, smooth-scaled fingers of the naga begin cradling the back of your head, gently firmly pushing you towards his crotch. Relaxing your throat, you allow his length to slide deeper, and deeper, feeling the ridges of his nonhuman cock pass your lips. Before much longer, you've got most of his hard length inside you. Vaguely recalling nuzzling into soft feathers with your nose, you try to take the rest, but the knot prevents you from doing so, being too large to easily pass your lips.";
		say "     You stay as you are for a long moment, swallowing purposefully and letting your throat muscles dance over the naga's dickhead, then tap the side of Moreau/Anton's forearm as you can feel your air supply start to run out. He allows you to pull off somewhat reluctantly, leaving you panting with your gaze glued to his wet and glistening shaft. Licking your lips, you repeat the words, 'Like my big cock, boy? You're good at this!' Then you reach up with one arm, sliding your hand over Moreau/Anton's and slam your head down onto his cock, ramming the shaft as far as it will go in one swift move. You can't help but gag and choke a little at the sudden penetration that you inflicted on yourself in remembrance of Anton's behavior, yet thankfully manage to calm yourself and relax enough to continue taking the long cock down your throat. Not that Moreau/Anton would have let you get away, as you continue to push his hand against your head.";

After the first one or two times, you don't even have to guide Moreau/Anton to do it either, with the naga fucking in and out of your mouth on his own accord. You can't help but feel that he's leaking more pre than before, as the spicy taste just becomes more intense on your tongue. Is he getting close? You can't quite tell, but either way, this is the moment in which you grab Moreau/Anton by the wrist and pull his hand away from the back of your head, more towards the side now. Placing his fingers on your jaw, you pull back off his erection with an audible pop, then guide him to lift your head so he can look you in the eyes. Your gaze meets his slitted eyes, and you casually register that his snake-hood is fully extended now, an majestic sight of overlapping scales.";

Waiting, you hear the sound of scales sliding over the concrete floor of the store's backroom, followed by a hand coming to rest on your lower back, warm against your skin. From there, it slides lower to caress the curve of your buttocks, finally slipping between your cheeks. The dry, scaly fingertip of Moreau brushes over your pucker, making it tingle a little.

Instead, one of his fingers slides into you almost gently, going in and out as it works more lube into your hole. Soon, it is joined by another, with the two digits moving apart to stretch your opening in preparation. You can sense that even though he is looking out for you, the whole process of going through this memory recall has wound up the naga more than a little bit, as he proceeds to withdraw his fingers before much longer.

A tingling feeling against your neck tells you that Moreau's flicking tongue is now literally tasting your skin, no longer just the air.

There is no doubt in your mind at this point that he's on another level entirely to Anton. 'You are fully relaxed and open for me. All you will feel is pleasure.' With that said, the naga withdraws his erection from your asshole with a smooth pull, his ridged cock sawing past your opening in a shockingly stimulating sensation, almost immediately followed by thrusting back into your depths.
