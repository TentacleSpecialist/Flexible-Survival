[New Intro Stuff

Book 1 - New World Building

Section 1 - New Time Period

The new Master of Hell intro will be a more modern version of the story, taking place in 2020 rather than 2008. This will allow for much more easy references(without having to do some crazy research on when they actually became a thing before or after a certain time) and will give the tech aspect of the game a lot more to go on.

Section 2 - New City Location

The location of the city will also have an adjustment to make it have more options. This version the city will be closer to northern california, the reason for this is that it will put it at the crossroads between california/oregon/nevada. With this location we will have access to more natural biomes that we wouldn't otherwise.

Section 3 - New Electrical Issues

The electricity of city being out will also be handled very different and actually have a pseudo dungeon aspect to it, the reason that this is so important is that electricity is a necessity and the fact that it was such a simple fix, it makes no sense that nobody else had just gone and fixed it. This new version will have the power plant function more as a... well a large power plant and it will also be the lair of an apex predator that can suck up the excess electricity and further explain why no one was able to reboot it yet.

Section 4 - Effects Of Phones On New World

Phones will be a big thing in this version, this is to add a much more simple avenue for content. You can take pictures with your phone, record things, and even receive messages from others. Not to mention that before you could realistically become bogged down by the tapes of others that you could find, with the phone you can simply make use of their small SD cards instead and save the info that you find onto your own. In the early part of this new mode you will be making use of generators to keep the phone charged, but once the power plant is fixed that will open more locations to charge it up, however there is a third optional level for the phone and that will be an electrical spirit that will keep you permanently charged.

Section 5 - Holidays & Social Events

With the new time system we will also be able to make use of prominent holidays, as well as potential birthdays and other types of celebrations, all of these can be saved in your phone. Another aspect of the phone is a now more plausible reason for the player to know if someone is about to go into labor with their offspring.

Section 6 - Weather

A potential new weather system may also be put into play, this will based via the months. What this means is that for example Jan. and Feb. are viewed in California as their rainy season so there would be more attention drawn to this in events and exploration.

Section 7 - Warring Factions

New 'warring factions' will be added to the game to create a immersive experience. We already have seen a bit of this with the soldier forces going up against the infected, but it also stands to reason that the infected would also be battling for dominance with each other. Examples would be more attention paid to the hyena gangs and the orc lairs raids on the populace and what would be happening during cross encounters. This will also present the player with the opportunity to aid them, either for items/allies/status. This wouldn't erase any faction, but it would alter the flow of events and make certain events unavailable for one side or vice versa. Another new part of the 'warring factions' content will be about claiming the citadel and with it starting your own army, this will give you the option to conquer other factions, aid them, or simply defend yourself. This will also add a new type of battle to the game that can be placed on auto or that you can actively watch.

Section 8 - New Relationship Values

Most relationships in the game are based around what the other character wants rather than the player, this addition will offer you ways to alter this. It will be broken down into stats and traits, these new stats will be: dominance, submission, loyalty, affection, obedience. The new traits will be different for each character and you will have the potential to even evolve as you explore the character more or alter said stats, they will both reflect their views as well as even potential kinks and fetishes. Part of these new relationship types will also be reflected in how characters interact with each other.

Section 9 - Endings

The previous time constraint on the player will be removed. The reason for this will be based around the political views in the rest of the country that will put most plans on hold. The quarantine is still in effect and based on an early napalm accident the people in charge are worried about how intense heat/radiation will alter the other organisms makeup. There will still be plenty of bad ends, but 'good ends' will be locked behind story progression.

This will showcase some of the features that will be associated with game stats.

Book 3 - New Stat/Variable/Trait Content For Other Characters

This will be broken down using the first companion that you will gain in 'Master of Hell', which is Brutus. More traits can be gained through progressing the story.

Section 1 - Starting Stats

The dominant and submissive stat are essentially the same, the only real difference is the positive vs negative numbers. While the other three are completely separate from each other.

Part 1 - Dominant/Submissive

In the beginning, this stat is very incredibly high and the only reason he submits to the player is the curse that has been placed on the necklace that the player wears.

Part 2 - Loyalty/Fear

This stat starts out fairly low, which makes sense since at the start he doesn't trust you and there is some slight fear at not knowing what you will do with him, or when he will be able to return to his master.

Part 3 - Affection/Hatred

Affection/Hatred - This stat will be very low at the start, based on the fact that he views you as someone that has enslaved him and wants nothing more than to watch you suffer for eternity.

Part 4 - Obedience/Rebellious

This stat in the beginning is very high because of the necklace, but will surprising not drop as much as you would think after the necklace is no longer in affect after a story event based on Brutus's feelings of being a weapon to be wielded by the one that 'owns' him.

Section 2 - Starting Variables

Part 1 - Clothing Variables

These variables are purely concerning outfits that the player can wear. They may effect pics, but they are more for effecting scenes, either as casual references or actually opening up new scenes and/or routes.

Nude - This is Brutus default costume.

Harem Garb - Eventually, you will be able to get this outfit for Brutus where he will be wrapped in revealing red silk.

Primal Garb - Eventually, you will be able to get this outfit for Brutus where he will be wrapped in furs and adorned with fangs and horns.

Warrior Garb - Eventually, you will be able to get this outfit for Brutus where he will be wrapped in black leather pant bracers and even a chest wrap.

Section 3 - Starting Traits

Part 1 - Non-Evolving Traits

These traits are ones that make up who Brutus is, and as such they can't be changed or altered they are simply a fabric of their character.

Childish Mentality - Because of the fact that he never had any type of education and never was able to mentally develop normally due to constantly being in pain, his mind behaves on a more simple and childish level. This is also what helps him to bond with younger beings such as Atticus without many complications.

Part 2 - Evolving Traits

These traits are ones that make up who Brutus is as well, but these ones can be altered by the player to change his outlook.

Low Self-Esteem - Brutus has always been viewed as a weapon and in the past has been subjected to mental/emotional/physical abuse, because of this he has very low opinions of himself and can't seem to fathom why anyone would want him around if not to use him.

Part 3 - Kinks/Fetishes Traits

These traits focus more on what he likes sexually and all are open to change depending on the player.

Polyamory - In the beginning Brutus has no concept of monogamy and thinks the practice to be ridiculous, but you may be able to change his mind if you so desire.

Non-Con - Brutus sees little point is 'asking' if he can bed someone, if he sees someone that he wants he simply takes them and becomes even more excited if they attempt to fight back against his advances.

Sexual Destruction - Brutus enjoys nothing more than being able to completely break someone sexually, this can be in a mental aspect such as shattering their mind, or physically such as ramming his cock in and fucking them till their hole can't even close.

Section 3 - Main Objectives

This will serve as a way to keep track of the main quests of the game, allowing you to see what point you're at and what your next goal should be.

Book 5 - New Creation Features

There will be many new ways to gain items other than simply finding them, in fact some items can only be acquired by these means.

Section 1 - Crafting

This will be the easiest crafting ability to master due to its simplicity. The way you learn how to craft new things is by either finding instructions, certain stat gains, or simply encountering certain objects in the world others have made. This is about simply combining basic items to make new ones.

Part 1 - Acquisition

This skill will be initially available after the game intro, but will require a lot of exploring to find some of the more useful recipes.

Part 2 - Recipes

2 branch + 1 flint = campfire
1 branch + 1 oil + 1 flint = torch
1 branch + 1 large rubber band = slingshot
1 branch + 1 sharp stone + 1 rope = shovel
4 wood + 16 nails = weak window blockade

Section 2 - Cooking

This is simple enough to understand, it's for creating new food and drink options. This can used to generate new food items that fill more hunger, thirst, and even health. It can also come in handy when dealing with other characters that may be hungry... or simply to make them like you more by giving them a gift. For creating food you will need a campfire though.

Part 1 - Acquisition

This skill will be initially available after the game intro, but will require a lot of exploring to find some of the more useful recipes.

Section 3 - Forging

This is a master trade, meaning that it will require you to have others do it for you, at least until you can find someone willing to train you in the art. This is about metalworking so without an actual forge it simply can't be used.

Part 1 - Acquisition

Other characters can do this for you at certain points in the game, however if you want to learn this skill you will need to recruit the orc forgemaster, this will also be the person that if you get closer to them will teach you how to do it yourself.

Section 4 - Alchemy

This is a master trade, meaning that it will require you to have others do it for you, at least until you can find someone willing to train you in the art. This about a mixture between chemistry and the supernatural, thankfully unlike the forge this can be used in more locations. Items made with this skill can be used to increase stats for a certain amount of time or even be used alter available scenes(drugging people, or helping them to turn something useless into something needed).

Part 1 - Acquisition

This will be able to be gained after you have the citadel as your own and gained access to its library. You can gain new recipes from certain other characters/researching in the library/raising your intelligence stat.

Section 3 - Waking Up

The player will wake up to the sound of their alarm and after some initial scene work the player will move into the bathroom.

Section 8 - Virginity & Main Sexual Weapon

You will end up seeing someone being attacked based on their 'Hot or Not' app choices and this will present you with a menu to attach either 'virginities' or 'novice' statuses for yourself(hands, mouth, pussy/cock, ass). The main reason for this is an alteration for scenes and feats which will be exampled later. The next option will be choosing your sexual weapon of choice which will decide your seduction attack lineup(mouth, breasts/pecs, cock, pussy, ass, body), the example of these will come later as well.

Chapter 1 - Virginity/Experience

Part 1 - Leveling up

Sexual acts of certain varieties will level up as you use them. The leveling system will be built up by battle fucking or training which most characters should have on offer, but the cooldown of training will be a lot longer than the sexual cooldown
Virgin - this can only be lost once unless you regrow a virginity by either getting a new part or by alchemy(cock/pussy/ass).
Novice - this will be the starting rank for non-virginity based parts
Experienced - this will serve as a medium level of accomplishment and majority of people will be content with this rating.
Master - this will be top tier and this will present a new outlook with your partners where for most you are able to push them past their known limits.

Part 2 - Virginity/Experience Effects

The effects on scenes will range from flavor text to completely different scenes depending on the situation and content. For the example I'll use Brutus, keep in mind different parts will handled in different ways, for example Brutus may view a virgin using their cock on him differently than a virgin using their ass/pussy.
For the explanation I will use the player having a cock and attempting to fuck Brutus.
Virgin - Brutus would more than likely not care about a players cock virginity and would view it the same as a novice, all in all a job to be done but not enjoyed.
Novice - As stated Brutus will be hardly impressed with this and may even showcase annoyance or boredom.
Experienced - This would be handled as 'normal' mode in the sense that this would be seen as an enjoyable scene for both people, but would not be classified as a perfect scene.
Master - This would reflect the player as a don juan/juana and would push Brutus past his known limits of pleasure which could unlock new sex options and/or stat bonus's

Part 3 - Feats

Chapter 2 - Sexual Weapon

Your 'sexual weapon' is simply the part of your body that you feel the most pride in and want to use to try an  entice others. After the prologue the player will have the ability to change their 'sexual weapon' on the fly to any of the options available since this will be used to decide your seduction attacks.

The options available to choose from will be as follows with some examples.
The all options is simply for people that don't care about which part of their body they use to entice others.

Mouth: sucking on your finger, caressing your lips
Breasts/Pecs: massaging your chest, pinching your nipples
Cock: grabbing and squeezing your bulge, openly stroking your cock
Pussy: moaning while rubbing your pussy, spreading your labia
Ass: caressing your ass, spanking yourself
Body: posing to show off your body, caressing your thighs
All: this option will give a large randomizer for all available options.


start game choices
choices should be simple to start: warding/game mode (no banning will be allowed in this version as it would serve no purpose).
scene starts with a riddle dream.
player wakes up in their bed by phone alarm.
player goes to mirror and a menu will pop up allowing the player to choose: race/hair style/hair color/eye color.
player goes to take shower and a menu will pop up allowing the player to choose: weight/definition/sex organs/chest/butt.
after shower player will go get dressed for work and the player will get a menu and be asked what career that they have and what hobby they have (each career has it's own starting outfit).
career and hobbies will alter starting stats and alter certain scenes in game.
player will get a pop up on their phone with a popular app asking 'hot or not' this will be where the player will be given a menu and can choose the genders that they are into.
before leaving the room the player will comment on a missing pet flyer that will lead to another menu, this will give you the chance to choose your own pet which will important as it will be one of your original two party members.
walking into the living room a picture will be mentioned this will serve as either a picture of your family or if you don't want a family just a picture of yourself.
create your family: you will be given an option on what makeup you want for your family and then choose from available option in the family.
slots will include potential: father/mother/older sibling/younger sibling (may have an option for a twin but that would remove both of the other sibling options).
creating family members will be simplified as there will be three options for each choice for example: drunk asshole father, religious and morally upright father, professional distant father, and goofy nerdy father.
when heading to work the player will see an attack and this will bring up the menu for their sexual experience.
